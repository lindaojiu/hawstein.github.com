                        <h2>前言</h2>

                        <p>《Cracking the coding interview》是一本被许多人极力推荐的程序员面试书籍，
                        详情可见：<a href="http://www.careercup.com/book">http://www.careercup.com/book</a>。
                        里面有150道程序员面试题目及相应的解答。书中大部分是编程题目，
                        并且配有相应的java程序(有些地方有错误或是有更优的方案)。我把书中的题目做了一遍，
                        并且记录下来，包含自己对问题的一些思路及看法，许多问题给出了两种以上的解答方案。
                        由于个人平时使用较多的是C++，所以程序是用C++编写，所有的代码都托管在Github上：</p>

                        <p>记录下来的主要目的是加深自己对问题的理解，如果此外还能对一两个人起到帮助作用，
                        那真真是再好不过了。:P</p>

                        <p>3.1
                        <a href="/posts/3.1.html">Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.
                        </a></p>

                        <p>3.2
                        <a href="/posts/3.2.html">How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, also has a function
                            min which returns the minimum element? Push, pop and min should all operate in
                            O(1) time.
                        </a></p>

                        <a href="/posts/3.3.html">Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple.
                            Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds
                            some threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this.
                            SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks, and should create a new stack once
                            the previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should
                            behave identically to a single stack (that is, pop() should return the same values as it
                            would if there were just a single stack).
                            FOLLOW UP
                            Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific
                            sub-stack.

                            order of size from top to bottom (e.g., each disk sits on top of an even larger one). You
                            have the following constraints:
                            (A) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
                            (B) A disk is slid off the top of one rod onto the next rod.
                            &copy; A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk.
                            Write a program to move the disks from the first rod to the last using Stacks.
